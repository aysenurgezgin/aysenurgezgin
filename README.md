Hello, I am Ayşe Nur Gezgin.
I graduated from Kocaeli University Mechatronics department. Since I decided that I wanted to improve myself in the field of software, which is among the Engineering fields that I see as a requirement of my department, I completed the Full Stack Developer training given by our valuable instructor Engin Niyazi Ergül at Wissen Academy. It is affiliated with Bahçeşehir University. After completing my course, I continue my career as a Junior Full Stack Developer.
